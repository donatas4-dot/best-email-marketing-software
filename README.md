‚ÄúAlgorithms change. Data shares stop. Platforms get banned. Relying on third-party channels makes brands vulnerable. First-party channels, on the other hand, leave brands in control of their customer engagement, making them critical for growing sales.‚Äù

Consumers are showing a growing interest in email offers and updates. Email open rates jumped 6% YoY, reaching 26.6% ‚Äî the fourth consecutive year of growth. But here‚Äôs the kicker: while click rates dipped from 1.49% to 1.22%, click-to-conversion rates grew by 27.6%. Why? Because buyers are starting to seek value and consolidating their purchases.

The standout countries were the United Kingdom, leading with a click-to-conversion rate of 14.37%, followed by Lithuania at 9.07% and Germany at 7.37%. These markets highlight how effective email can be at turning interest into action.

When it comes to automations, they continue to outperform. Last year, a mere 2% of total email volume accounted for an incredible 37% of all email-driven sales. And look at the conversion rates ‚Äî one in every three people who clicked on an automated message made a purchase.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre ignoring automated messages, stop. They‚Äôre the cheat code to first-time and repeat sales.‚Äù

Greg Zakowicz, Omnisend‚Äôs Senior Ecommerce Expert


Compared to manual campaigns, automated messages outperformed across the board with:
+52% better open rates
+332% higher click rates
+2361% better conversion rates (yes, you read that right)

Start where it counts ‚Äî abandoned carts, welcome messages, and browse abandonment emails. Together, these were the top three automation types sent last year and make up 87% of all automated orders.

Back-in-stock emails are also proven winners, with a 59.19% open rate and 5.34% conversion rate. They harness social proof (it sold out before) and FOMO (don‚Äôt miss it again), making urgency and popularity powerful drivers of sales.

And here‚Äôs a standout stat: one in every two people who click on an automated welcome and abandoned cart email makes a purchase. 

So, if you haven‚Äôt developed a strong automation strategy yet, you‚Äôre leaving serious revenue on the table.

SMS isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù anymore, it‚Äôs a must. With 31% more messages sent YoY, brands are catching on to the power of direct, no-nonsense communication. And it‚Äôs paying off ‚Äî US brands generated over $25 million in SMS sales alone in 2024.

Automated SMS accounted for 18% of orders while making up just 9% of all sends. No surprise here, as we see that click rates for SMS automations were +147% higher than campaigns, and conversion rates were +118% better. 

The United Kingdom took the success of SMS campaigns even further, with a click-to-conversion rate reaching 10.65% compared to the global average of 2.18%.

Push notifications may not be the loudest channel, but they‚Äôre pulling their weight ‚Äî and then some. Campaign volume grew 55% YoY, with metrics like +37% higher click rates and +28% more orders.

And automation? With an average click-to-conversion rate of 13.94%, it‚Äôs safe to say that automated push notifications truly shine. In some countries, though, they don‚Äôt just shine ‚Äî they dominate: click-to-conversion rates reached an impressive 25% in Canada, 51% in Australia, and an extraordinary 60% in France.

Generally, conversion rates for automated push notifications were 500% higher than campaigns, with view and click rates improved by 28% and 65%, respectively. 

Unlike crowded ad spaces, push notifications give brands an affordable, direct line to customers. Whether it‚Äôs a last-minute cart reminder or a flash sale alert, they‚Äôre proving indispensable.
